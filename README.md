# interactive-form-v3
 Form interacting with Javascript

I create and added a span element for all the fields that are required.
That shows an example of how a correct field should look like.
I did this to give the user more information as to the way the validation fails for that specific input(if the user does not provide correct data).

This span elements will be display just under "*- required fields" at the top of the page
